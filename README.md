SavingStringApp solves the problem of data being araised when an action is performed (in our case exiting and restarting an application). 
To solve the problem of data being eraised, we used UserDefaults database, where we stored key-value pairs persistently across launches of our app. 
As can be seen in the video, on 00:19 we enter the value to the Input textBox - Aruzhan Koshkarova. 
After pressing the Save Data button and relauncing the app, SaveStringApp outputs the last saved input-Aruzhan Koshkarova (as can be seen on 00:52)
